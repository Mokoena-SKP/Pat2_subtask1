Brief overview

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using standardized sequences of two different signal durations called "dots" (⋅) and "dashes"1 (−). These signals can be transmitted as electrical pulses, radio waves, visible light, or sound.2

Historical Context

Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel F.B. Morse, an American artist and inventor, along with his collaborators Alfred Vail and Joseph Henry.3 It was initially created for use with the electrical telegraph, which allowed for the first time nearinstantaneous communication over long distances. The first public demonstration of the telegraph and Morse code was in 1837, and the first official Morse code message, "What hath God wrought?", was sent in 1844.
Initially, Morse's code was adapted for the English language. However, to accommodate other languages with diacritic marks, a variant called the International Morse Code was established in 1851 by a conference of European nations.4 This international version is the standard used globally today.5 Morse code became crucial for maritime and military communication and was widely used until the late 20th century before being largely replaced by more modern digital communication methods.

How Morse Code Works

The Morse code system assigns a unique combination of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, numerals (0-9), and some punctuation marks and procedural signals (prosigns).6 Here's a breakdown of the elements:
 Dot (⋅): Represents a short signal.7  Dash (−): Represents a signal that is three times as long as a dot.8
 Intra-character space: Between the dots and dashes within a character, there is a short silence equal to the duration of one dot.
 Inter-character space: Between letters of a word, there is a silence equal to the duration of three dots.9
 Word space: Between words, there is a longer silence equal to the duration of seven dots.10
For example, the letters "SOS," a well-known distress signal, are represented in Morse code as:
 S: ⋅⋅⋅  O: −−−
Therefore, "SOS" in Morse code is ⋅⋅⋅−−−⋅⋅⋅.11The design of Morse code prioritized efficiency. More frequently used letters in the English language were assigned shorter sequences of dots and dashes. For instance, the letter "E," the most common letter, is represented by a single dot (⋅).12 Morse code can be transmitted and received through various means, including sound (short and long tones), light (short and long flashes), and electrical pulses (short and long key presses).13 Skilled operators can often interpret Morse code by ear.
